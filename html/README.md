<h2>HTML Directory</h2>

I have made this directory to put the static html that I'm using to design the store front. Alex made the mockup in photoshop, and I'm coding it in static html here.

Later, we will use this template and add our JS functionality.

You can see a live preview of this template here: http://graemeboy.com/apteetude/html/

Feel free to comment on it as we progress in this phase of static template development.
